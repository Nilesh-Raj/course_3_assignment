my final dataset created and named as _run.analysis.txt_ which contains 180 observations/rows and 68 columns.

#MODIFICATION MADE
-Set the column name of X_test(Test_set is object name) as all the rows of second column of features dataset
-extract only std() and mean() and merged with y_test(Test_labels is object name) and subject_test.
-above two process is repeated same for train dataset
-mearge train and test ataset
-finding average of the combined dataset

#description of dataset
-first two columns are labelled as Activity_1 and Activity_2 that shows activity id and activity respectively.
-the variable remaining are calculated means and standard deviation that are as follows :
